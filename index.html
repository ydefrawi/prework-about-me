      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>I am a Marketing Coordinator for a local marketing firm and an aspiring developer.</p>
      <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
      <p>Houston, Texas. My family is Egyptian. </p>
      <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
      <p>Making and listening to music, weightlifting, gaming, anything self-improvement related. </p>
      <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
      <p>Running a business that would enable me to work from anywhere in the world.</p>
      <h1>Where do you live?</h1>
      <p>Houston, Texas</p>
      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>I work with Wordpress on occasion and I've always had to outsource any real 'development' that needs to be done. I'd love to be able to handle such tasks on my own. Plus, I love creating things in general. To me, development feels like painting on an empty canvas. Creating something functional from nothing. I love that aspect. </p>
